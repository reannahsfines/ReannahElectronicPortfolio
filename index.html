      <p>
        My name is Reannah Sheantelle Fines, and I am a senior graduating in 2025. Throughout high school, I’ve always been a quiet and shy student, but I never let that stop me from getting my work done and staying focused. My pathway in high school was Cybersecurity, and taking that class has been a really fun and eye-opening experience. It introduced me to the world of coding and technology, and I learned a lot about data, and coding. Even though I enjoyed Cybersecurity, I plan to major in Psychology in college. Eventually, I want to pursue a career in Neuropsychology, where I can explore the connection between the brain and behavior. I’m excited for the future and proud of everything I’ve accomplished so far.

    <h2>Career Objective</h2>
    <p>
      I want to pursue a career in Neuropsychology because I am deeply fascinated by the connection between the brain and behavior. Understanding how injuries, illnesses, and conditions affect memory, attention, and emotion drives my curiosity, and wonder. Neuropsychology allows me to combine my passion for having a desire to help others—whether through assessing changes, contributing to supporting individuals in understanding their mental health. I am motivated by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in people’s lives while continuously learning about the complexities of the human mind.
